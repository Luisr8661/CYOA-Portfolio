# CYOA-Portfolio

So this choose your own adventure was inspired by the newest pokemon games, pokemon scarlet and pokemon violet. 
with what time we had me and my partner split up the work between the three differeny paths that you can take throughout the game.
I did the legends road path because it was the longest and my partner did the the titan and starfall paths as they are shorter but require more attention.
